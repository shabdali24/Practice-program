** HashMap **
1) Hashmap is combination of key-value paired, unordered set.
2) In hashmap ey is unique and value may be duplicate.

# Implementation of hashmap--
1) put()           - for insert pair
2) get()           - retrieve data from map.
3) containsKey()   - search value by their key in map
4) remove()        - delete or remove pair from map
5) size()          - find the size of pair which present in map.
6) keySet()        - fetch all keys for set format from map.

#
1) Hash map internally implements as a array of linked list.
  e.g.-
         key    value
      1) india  150
      2) china   90
      3) us      60
      4) nepal    5
      5) bangladesh 2
      6) canada     1

      declared two variable
      n = 6; this is data size or pair which is present in map.
      N = 4= bucket; this is node and is also index size of array

2) Hashing - change data form
   e.g.
       "abc --> 345; like that
