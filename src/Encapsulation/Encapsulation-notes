***   Encapsulation  ****

# Encapsulation :-
          Is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit known as encapsulation.
  Realtime Examples -
  1) school bag
  2) bank account -
       -Suppose you have an account in the bank. If your balance variable is declared as a public variable in the bank
        software, your account balance will be known as public, In this case, anyone can know your account balance. So,
        would you like it? Obviously No.
       -So, they declare balance variable as private for making your account safe, so that anyone cannot see your account
        balance.
       -The person who has to see his account balance, will have to access only private members through methods defined
        inside that class and this method will ask your account holder name or user Id, and password for authentication.
       -Thus, we can achieve security by utilizing the concept of data hiding. This is called Encapsulation in Java.
